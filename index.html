        <p> Hey, I'm Skyan Samuel.
        <br> I'm an and have been an aspriring software and game dev ever since 2017. 
            I've done Scratch since 2016 and Unity since mid 2018. I've also used other environments. 
            I created Skyrift Studios to publish my games and have and a contributor of a few projects. <br>
            In my freetime I like to work on games, software, videos, art, stories & writing, and a bit of animation. Also a map enthusiast, I love drawing them!
            I also love to play Minecraft & Cities: Skylines. (Roblox & Fortnite suck) An all-rounder. <br>
            Also recently I've been dabbling with music in FL Studio, LMMS, and MuseScore. I'm not the best @ music theory though. ;)
            That's about it. Feel free to explore more. (If i put links here).
